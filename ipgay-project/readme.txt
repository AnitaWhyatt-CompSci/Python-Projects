This is a brief readme for my homework #1 submission

Problem 1 works exactly as described in the prompt, and 
its test suit can be invoke with "igpay.py" on the command line

For problem 2 I was asked to "enhance" my igpay.py file. In order to
accomplish this without changing my original submission for problem 1
I created igpay2.py which also has a test suite that can be invoked with
"igpay2.py" on the command line.
atinlay.py uses igpay2.py to translate its strings

Invoke atinlay.py on the command line with the form:
atinlay.py testfile.txt

The supported alphabet is a-z and A-Z
The supported punctuation is ['.' ',' ';' ':' '!' '?'] and ' embedded within a word.
Other punctuation will cause a crash.

Finally, part of the prompt I was unable to fullfill is that my
program does not keep track of tabs or newlines.  The translated output will
be printed on a single line with single spaces.

I look forward to any feedback you may have for me.  Thanks for taking the time 
to read through all this!
