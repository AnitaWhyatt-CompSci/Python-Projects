With further research, not only did I find their 100-day
trial and limited "forever warranty" that covers
manufacturing defects, I found lots of positive reviews from
others who'd bought from Allform, which definitely helped
ease my hesitation.

Ultimately we ordered a very handsome whiskey leather loveseat
with walnut legs which arrived in three large boxes within a
week of ordering. Yep - in boxes; this is definitely a "couch
in a box" situation where the buyer is required to do some
minimal assembly.
