Hello Professor!
I am re-submitting my homwork after making two changes.
First, I corrected an error associated with lone punctuation
not attaced to any word.
Second, I made sure the filenames always display alphabetized.

It is worth mentioning my code works only with ASCII text.
I tried copy-pasting articles from the internet, but wound up
discoverint there were hidden charachters that crashed my code.
If your test files include non-ASCII hidden charachters the
program will likely fail.

Problem 1:
>python concordance.py

#(ensure colors.txt, and fruit.txt are available for test suite)


Problem 2:
>python concord.py afile.txt bfile.txt cfile.txt #etc.

#(I have included afile, bfile, and cfile if you would like to test with them as well.)


Thank you!
I look forward to your feedback professor!
