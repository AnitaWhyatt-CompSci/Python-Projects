One of our COVID-19 quarantine projects has been to re-do
my fiance's office space.  It's still a work in progress,
but the crux of the makeover was to swap out his hand-me-down,
bachelor pad couch for an updated number. In the search, I came
across ALLform, a U.S.-based furniture company that specializes
in modern, modular designs. I was sold on the look of the
couches, but as a highly picky furniture shopper, I wasn't
going to rest on looks alone - especially when shopping online.
