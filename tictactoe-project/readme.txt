Hello Professor!


I should inform you that my code is not precisely to prompt.
You instructed us to build our tkinter project as a a child class of tkinter.Frame

Trying to do this seemed to change the syntax too radically, and caused some issues. 
So, I have developed this as an ordinary tkinter application.

Besides that singular issue, my code should function exactly according to specification.
The interface, game logic, and Player X AI all work as they should.
Simpley run
>>>python tictactoe.py
And enjoy the game!

I look forward to reviewing your feedback.
