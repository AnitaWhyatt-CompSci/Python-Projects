Hello Professor!

The extension I chose to install in my pylife.py script,
was the "Run" button.  When pressed it calls the step function
once per second.

As with the previous assignment I stayed on prompt as much as
I could but deviated in some ways.  Rather than a class CellArray
to hold cell data, I use a list cellArray to hold cell data.

Also, my script is slightly buggy in some ways.  After pressing step 
a few times, it seems to have trouble accepting new edits to the canvas,
and must be restarted.
I was able to perform the smiley face example you included in the prompt.

I look forward to your feedback!
